# Automobile Maintenance Tracker

Automobile Maintenance Tracker is a maintenance tracker.

  - Uses KnockoutJS framework
  - Supports three car types: Electric, Gas and Diesel. 
  - Each vehicle has at minimum a make, model, year and odometer reading. 
  - Maintenance tasks should include 2-3 things like oil changes or tire rotations. However, not all maintenance tasks can be applied to all vehicles (an electric car wonâ€™t need an oil change).

# Tracker supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete)!

  - Create new service orders and the data is added automatically to the table
  - Changes made to the service orders are displayed instantly
  - Update exisiting service orders
  - Delete existing service orders


### Tech

Automobile Maintenance Tracker uses various libraries for data manipulation and designing user interface:

* [Bootstrap] -  Front-end component library
* [MDBootsrap] - Material Design for Bootstrap to design UI
* [KnockoutJS] - Javascript Framework (MVVM)
* [UnderscoreJS] - Javascript data manipulation
* [jQuery] - To control DOM elements and trigger functions based on events

And of course Automobile Maintenance Tracker itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
