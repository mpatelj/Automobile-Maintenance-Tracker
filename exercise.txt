PROGRAMMING PROBLEM:  Automobile Maintenance Tracker

 

Create a simple object-oriented library for tracking automobile maintenance. The system should support at least three car types: electric, gas and diesel. Each vehicle should have at minimum a make, model, year and odometer reading. Maintenance tasks should include 2-3 things like oil changes or tire rotations. However, not all maintenance tasks can be applied to all vehicles (an electric car wonâ€™t need an oil change).

 

Your library or API should be capable of listing, adding, updating and removing entries at run time. Supply automated unit tests to demonstrate your features.

 

Demonstrate usage using a web interface. You must also demonstrate your knowledge of how javascript can be used to provide functionality in the UI.

 

This problem is evaluated based on the design of your library and how usable it would be to others.
